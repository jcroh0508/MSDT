the australian defence force must defend and project across an air-sea gap. this requires long range autonomous strike weaponry. the joint strike fighter does not solve this issue and detrimentally places added pressure on australia's limited force of aerial refuelling assets. the world's defence manufacturers are not creating strike platforms that solve australian needs. for this reason, australia needs to look to other nations with similar defence needs. in this case, japan, south korea and taiwan all face defending an air-sea gap. australia should enter a partnership with these nations to create a strike fighter that satisfies the strategic needs of defending an air-sea gap. the benefits of such a partnership will be many .  	 3
